NAME
    CGI::NeedSSL - module to check SSL status of a CGI call.

DESCRIPTION
    Though some servers are configured with a separate cgi-bin directory for
    SSL-only CGI, many allow CGI to be called either via http: or https:
    URLS.

    This module allows SSL-only to be checked and enforced by a perl CGI
    program.

SYNOPSIS
    use CGI::NeedSSL qw( croak_unless_via_SSL ); croak_unless_via_SSL();

METHODS
        item cgi_is_via_SSL()

        Return 1 if https/SSL in effect, otherwise return undef.

    croak_unless_via_SSL()
        Die, via a call CGI::Croak::croak, unless https/SSL is in effect.
        Prints an HTML message (using the CGI module) suggesting the script
        be called via https://. This default message can be changed with
        cgi_user_error_msg().

    cgi_user_error_msg()
        Set and/or return the current error msg. The error message set by
        the user should be fully HTML, except for the header which the
        routine prints first-- ie, something like '<HTML><HEAD>NO
        SSL!</HEAD><BODY>Call us with https://</BODY></HTML>'.

    cgi_error_exit()
        Prints our error message and exits.
